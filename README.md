# EWS
Python functions for early warning signal analysis
This repository contains functions for EWS analysis using ACF, Variance and DFA.
ACF1 surrogates are also added.
The file Window_RPWriter_ConstRR_v2.py conducts EWS analysis using recurrence plots at constant RR. It uses the outfile UD, which is written in cpp, which rank trasforms the data and the rp module provided by TOCSY (Marwan, N., Romano, M. C., Thiel, M., Kurths, J.: Recurrence Plots for the Analysis of Complex Systems, Physics Reports, 438(5-6), 2007, 237-329)
This project is under constaruction and will be updated with usage instructions over time.
